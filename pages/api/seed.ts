        body: "All beginnings are tough, as you have to cope with the challenges faced as a fresher. The beginning of your PhD isn’t an exception. The goal of your first days as a PhD student is to be ready as soon as possible to start your research. This article is to help you coup with your first week during your PhD. Read until the end, as you will find it useful.\r\n\r\n1.Find a coffee mug\r\nThis is necessary because your PhD won’t be relaxed as you thought, because you have to work hard and sometimes only coffee can keep you awake when you are on your computer. You had better be ready now so as to be productive.\r\n\r\n2.Get your desk and chair\r\nThis is necessary as you will spend long hours doing research. You should choose a comfortable chair. This will help you to avoid lower back pain while you do your research.\r\n\r\n3.Do the paper work\r\nMost likely, when you begin your PhD, you will have to give personal and contact details, fill in several forms and give out lots of details about you. It is better you get these ready on time so as to be focused on your PhD.\r\n\r\n4.Have access to university building\r\nSince you will be working in a school environment, it is vital that you have access to it because the building might have some security measures put in place. You are going to work in the weekends also, therefore its better you get permission to be in the building anytime you want to work.\r\n\r\n5.Get a computer\r\nYou will need a PC, so get yours along with you, and if you already don’t have, order for one. Your PC should be connected to the web so as to enable your research run faster. You should also get a printer and other necessary computing items like software, access to shared drives and others.\r\nImportant note! If you will be using your Laptop, get a lock so that it won’t be stolen from you.\r\n\r\n6.Stock office supplies\r\nWhatever you can do to get them, please do because such office supplies as stock post-its, a stapler, highlighters, paperclips, a few pens and some notebooks are useful for your PhD.\r\n\r\n7.Make the secretary your friend\r\nYou might think that your professor is the most powerful person when it comes to your PhD, but you are wrong. The secretary, who controls the professor’s agenda, can help you squeeze an appointment no matter how crowded the agenda is. So make her your friend.\r\n\r\n8.Register to courses\r\nYou need to have a clear vision on the courses available to you, the compulsory ones, the optional ones and the ones that are nice to do. Whatever the case, it is wise to sit with your boss and discuss about the courses that will benefit you the most.\r\n\r\n9.Download papers to read\r\nYou will be reading lots of papers at the beginning of your PhD, so don’t only ask your boss which ones you should read, go get them, plenty books and papers related to your research topic and read. To find papers to read, use Google Scholar, ask your Liberian and also make use of PubMed.\r\n\r\n10.Start a literature review\r\nYou need to start doing literature review, gather papers, read and summarise them then organise your learning. If you engage in proper literature review, the overview of your field will be more accurate and your whole work more easier.\r\n\r\n11.Check previous thesis of your group\r\nThis is important because you can know the type of topics preferred in your group, how a PhD is structured in your faculty, how many papers PhD’s published before graduating and many more.\r\n\r\n12.Craft a research plan\r\nAlthough this might sound awkward to you, still you can give it a try by splitting your PhD into 4-6 blocks, with each one well defined to produce a publication. Make the design to make your initial project easy so as to yield results earlier as this will be a motivating factor for you.\r\n\r\n13.Meet your supervisor/professor\r\nYou need to meet with your professor to ensure that both of you are on the same track and are in agreement on what you will be doing and how you choose to do it.\r\n\r\n14.Meet your new colleagues\r\nMeeting your colleagues is important so that you know what their project is all about and what contributions and help you can offer to each other.\r\n\r\n15.Be social\r\nBeing social will help you a lot. Make friends; invite your colleagues for coffee breaks, lunch, or any social gatherings. This will help you gain more friends and support as your life isn’t restricted to your research alone.",

        title: "3 Fat-Loss Myths – Debunked",
        body: "Have you ever tried losing weight, thought you were doing everything correctly, and still didn’t see the progress you wanted? Sure, there are a number of reasons why you weren’t seeing the results, but what if the changes you made to your diet weren’t actually that helpful–or even downright useless?\r\n\r\nThere are numerous myths surrounding the “best” eating plans and nutrition protocols for successful (and rapid) weight loss. Unfortunately, these myths often become prominent hallmarks within the programs of unknowing individuals who pursue their fitness goals with misguided information. They find themselves bound to unhelpful, sometimes dangerous eating rules for years on end before they discover it’s been for naught.\r\n\r\nIn this article I’ll cover three popular fat-loss myths, all relevant to concerns regarding metabolism–the chemical process within your body responsible for producing and burning energy (calories).\r\n\r\nMyth #1: Metabolism Can’t Be Altered\r\n\r\nWith the release of a New York Times article discussing the unfortunate outcome of many “Biggest Loser” contestants, many people come to believe that their metabolism is out of their control. Fortunately, this isn’t completely true. While prolonged weight loss can cause “metabolic adaptation” (the slowing of your metabolism to adjust to the new level of nutrient intake), a regular strength-training routine can help combat this adaptation by increasing one’s resting metabolic rate—the number of calories one burns at rest. This occurs because muscle is “metabolically active,” meaning muscle tissue requires extra energy to maintain itself. This extra energy needed for maintenance and growth of muscle tissue can slow the rate of this metabolic slowdown, and help increase metabolic rate once a goal weight is reached.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, more modest calorie restrictions can help prevent unnecessary metabolic adaptation. A good rule of thumb is to eat the most amount of calories that still allows you to lose weight. This not only slows down the rate of metabolic adaptation, but will also leave you with additional wiggle room to further reduce calories when your program calls for it.\r\nMyth #2: Small, Frequent Meals Help Stoke The “Metabolic Fire.” \r\n\r\nThere was an old belief that small frequent meals would speed up metabolism, because just like a fire, constantly supplying the body with nutrients would keep the “metabolic fire” aflame. However, research conducted on this subject found that eating only two meals a day, compared to three meals a day, had no effect on total energy expenditure throughout the day.\r\n\r\nDoes this mean frequent meals are a waste of time? Not necessarily, as more frequent meals may be able to help individuals better control total calorie consumption (by avoiding binge-like eating behaviors). However, some individuals find it easier to eat fewer meals throughout the day, both as a way to help control appetite and because it simply fits better with their lifestyle. The best approach is to find an eating frequency that works for you–allowing you to successfully eat the proper amount of nutrients while maintaining a modest calorie deficit.\r\n\r\nMyth #3: Calories Eaten Late At Night Will Turn to Fat\r\n\r\nNumerous studies have shown a correlation between late night eating and weight gain. However, this weight gain was likely caused as a result of total caloric over-consumption, and not because of its effect on their metabolism. In other words, late-night snack eaters consume more calories because they are ingesting additional food when their non-snacking counterparts are sleeping or engaging in other, non-food related activities. The research is clear: as long as you remain in a calorie deficit, consuming a meal close to bedtime does not increase fat accumulation more than a meal consumed during normal daytime hours.\r\n\r\nIf eating close to bedtime (such as in an intermittent fasting diet) works best for your lifestyle, go right ahead. Some individuals might even find it easier to fall asleep when they aren’t trying to ignore hunger pangs because they haven’t eaten since 4pm.\r\n\r\nThe realities behind these myths provide some promising insights:\r\n\r\n• Metabolism is a dynamic process. Yes, it adapts and slows down the longer you remain on a weight-loss diet, but you can also combat and reverse this effect through strength training and gradual calorie changes.\r\n• Meal frequency has a much smaller affect on fat accumulation than previously believed. (Almost negligible.) This means you have much more freedom to time your meals in a manner that fits best with your lifestyle–making your nutrition plan easier to maintain.\r\n• As long as you remain in a modest calorie deficit, eating just before bed is OK. So if you’re like me and enjoy a bedtime snack before getting some shuteye, go on with your Halo-Top eating self.",

        title: "7 Habits to Lose Weight with any Diet",
        body: "When it comes to weight loss, the concern of most people is trying to select the most effective diet. No doubt some diets are more recommendable than others, but in the long term the results depend more on habits than on specific diets.\r\n\r\nIf you see change as something temporary, you will surely fail. When you go back to your usual habits, the usual kilos will come back, plus some extra.\r\n\r\nYou must of course choose a good eating plan, but then focus on the new habits to develop. In this article you will learn about the habits that are usually associated with long-term success, and concrete ideas for incorporating them. \r\n\r\n1. Allow some flexibility (Flexible Control).\r\n\r\nVery restrictive diets are difficult to maintain over time. Eliminating foods you enjoy forever\r\nreduces adherence by requiring too much willpower. In addition, we want more of what we\r\ncan't have, and this rigid control raises the risk of cravings (study) and possibly binge eating.\r\nOn the other hand, excessive flexibility is also negative. To achieve certain goals you must\r\nmake certain sacrifices, and that means setting limits for yourself.\r\n\r\nThat ideal balance point is what some studies call \"flexible control,\" which will vary from\r\nperson to person.\r\n\r\nMaintaining flexible control involves paying attention to food and following certain guidelines, but understanding that your progress doesn't stop because you have your favorite pizza for dinner one day. It's about prioritizing real food and being mindful of portions, without self-punishing or blaming yourself if one day you overeat or eat something undesirable.\r\n\r\nWhile this flexible control facilitates the maintenance of lost weight, rigid control is\r\nassociated with worse long-term results. In addition, rigid control can lead to a dangerous obsession with achieving a supposed dietary purity. When you fail in this impossible mission, you break down, worsening your results. \r\n\r\nAvoid the all-or-nothing mentality. Seek progress, not perfection.\r\n\r\n2. Reduce snacks\r\n\r\nThe belief that we should eat five or six meals a day is a recent one. In the 1970s most people ate three large meals a day, but this number increased over time.On the one hand, nutritional recommendations leaned toward smaller meals, thinking that this would better control hunger and keep metabolism high (both ideas are wrong). On the other hand, the food industry increased its promotion of mid-morning and mid-afternoon snacks.\r\n\r\nThey knew that if we increase the number of daily intakes we will tend to eat more, and big\r\nstomachs are more profitable than small ones. Thus, the average number of meals increased from the typical three meals a day just a few decades ago to the current five or six. Calories from snacks have increased in all age ranges, contributing to the current caloric excess Snacks are adding more and more calories. \r\n\r\n3. Cook more and eat out less\r\n\r\nCooking is one of the best skills you can develop. It's not about elaborating sophisticated\r\ndishes, but about defending yourself with the basics. In the time Master Chef lasts, you can\r\nprepare food for several days. You will also avoid exposing yourself to their misleading\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\nCooking more at home and eating less in restaurants are habits that are associated with less weight gain .\r\n\r\nWhen cooking you have much more control over your meals, both their size and their\r\ningredients. You will certainly use better oils and lower calorie sauces.\r\n\r\nIf you eat out often, try to follow some rules:\r\n1. Tell them not to put bread or snacks on the table.\r\n2. If you order salad, have them serve the sauce on the side, or simply add oil and\r\nvinegar.\r\n3. Ask them to swap undesirable side dishes (such as chips) for some salad.\r\n4. You don't have to eat everything on your plate. Eating more than you need is also\r\nwasting food, and you will carry the excess with you in the form of fat. Besides, in most\r\nrestaurants you can take the leftovers with you.\r\n5. Skip dessert, or just order a piece of fruit.\r\n\r\n4. Reconnect with your body's signals\r\n\r\nIf you have followed a strict diet, for example a ketogenic or PSMF approach, you have\r\nprobably had to count calories and macronutrients. This has benefits and I recommend doing it for a while, but if you do it consistently you raise the risk of disconnecting from your body.\r\n\r\nOnce you are at your ideal weight, you must learn to reconnect with your body's internal\r\nsignals, stopping eating when you are satisfied, without becoming full. This is precisely what is recommended by the millenary Japanese technique of Hara hachi bu, or 80% belly.\r\nThe goal is for your body, not your phone, to tell you when to stop eating. \r\n\r\nTo achieve this, you must be more conscious when eating, and this is precisely the following recommendation.\r\n\r\n5. Be more conscious when eating\r\n\r\nWe make more than 200 food decisions a day, most of them unconscious (detail). If you don't think about what you eat and don't control your portions, you will be at the mercy of your impulses and easily manipulated by commercial interests. \r\n\r\nIn fact, this process of awareness should begin long before you sit down at the table. When\r\nyou go shopping, take a list with you. Don't buy anything that is not on the list if you don't\r\nneed it, even if it is on sale. Refuse free samples.\r\n\r\nAt mealtime, chew calmly and pay attention ,avoiding eating in front of the TV or in the\r\npresence of any other distraction (like checking Instagram). Eat the allotted portion and do not repeat, unless you are really hungry.\r\n\r\nDon't eat directly from the fridge or packaging. Take out the portion, serve it on a plate and\r\nsave the rest.\r\n\r\nIn short, it's about becoming more aware of the choices you make around food, and that\r\nincreased awareness will improve your behavior (meta-analysis).Remind yourself often why you do this. Aligning your behavior with your values improves your ability to self-regulate, tolerate uncomfortable feelings, and become more aware of your decisions.\r\n\r\n6. Weigh yourself frequently\r\n\r\nI know this recommendation is not very popular, but the evidence is clear. People who weigh\r\nthemselves frequently lose more weight and regain less weight. People who weigh themselves more frequently lose more weight. \r\n\r\nSome believe that weighing can generate anxiety, but the evidence does not seem to support this idea. And if this were to happen, it would not be the fault of the scale, but of our\r\nrelationship with weight. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, you must understand that weight fluctuations are normal, and that your progress is measured by many other variables (measurements, muscle, performance, energy level...). Furthermore, if you gain two kilos of muscle and lose two kilos of fat, your body will look much better, even though your weight has not undergone any variation. \r\n\r\nBut all this does not imply that you should ignore weight, but understand it and put it in\r\ncontext. And above all, you should avoid linking your personal worth to the value indicated by the scale. If you allow your weight to define you, stopping weighing yourself does not solve the problem.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit of weighing yourself frequently is that you see the trend more clearly,\r\navoiding that punctual fluctuations make you make wrong decisions. Don't obsess about your weight, but don't ignore it either.\r\n\r\n7. Include physical activity\r\n\r\nIncreasing physical activity, especially strength training, will not only enhance the results of the diet, but is one of the habits most strongly associated with long-term weight maintenance.\r\nExercise benefits us by multiple mechanisms:\r\n1. It helps regulate appetite.\r\n2. It improves insulin sensitivity.\r\n3. It raises metabolism, especially strength training.\r\n4. Increases energy expenditure.\r\n5. It improves our mood.\r\n\r\nSummary and conclusions\r\n\"All happy families resemble each other, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way\" - Leo Tolstoy (Anna Karenina).\r\n\r\nThe so-called Anna Karenina principle indicates that success requires the presence of many\r\nspecific factors, while failure can be explained by the lack of any one of them. Success is\r\ntherefore a much more fragile state, since in the absence of certain conditions it will result in chaos.",

This dynamic character can be utilized to refer to The Scarlet Singapore, an 80-room mischievous ultra-posh resort in Lion City. Scarlet is the property’s muse and fictional character —think about a maid in fishnets, stilettos, and a garter belt. She's the theory which drives the resort’s ethos, layout, and expertise.\r\n\r\nThis property is that of attitude, but its audacious guise, lavish décor, and its bold colours aren't for everybody. Situated in the Ann Siang Hill neighborhood that is fashionable, it's among the best destinations in Singapore for well-known expats who flock to the region throughout the week to get a meal that is nice or during weekends for a few late night fun. Specialty shops, fashionable restaurants, and wine bars surround it, using its labyrinth of hawker stores selling affordable and cheerful dishes and a block away you will find Chinatown. Nearby is the city’s bustling financial district you’ll find businesspeople, as well as women, rushing from one assembly to another.\r\n\r\nScarlet's ruby red façade is unbelievably different from the white and grey colours of its contiguous buildings. The lobby is furnished with velvet high back seats and materials in garnet reds cobalt and chartreuse mustard. An intricate chandelier; bejeweled, dark red and upholstered wall in the reception space; as well as a drawing room with period pieces, lovely antiques, art, and books come together to form this sexy and visually-exciting surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe resort is masterfully hewn from what was once living quarters in the early 1900s for women factory workers. The part of Scarlet is a vivacious host dripping with jewelry, certainly presents from her gentlemen callers that are adoring. This layout theory is interpreted into a property overflowing with opulent and sparkling layers of details.\r\n\r\nThe 75 rooms and five suites are spread over six floors of row houses that are linked. The hallways are very long, sloping and narrow with leather saddle bags on each and every door for keeping a note from the staff or the day's paper. The interesting thing about boutique hotels that are recovered from the past is the fact that no two rooms are alike. Each has differing shapes and a distinct nature, some with verandas that are excellent and walkout patios, other with views of the red rooftops of the surrounding buildings or of the downtown region. However, what they all have in common is their nature that is provocative.\r\n\r\nAll rooms have excellent décor with whimsical and tasteful graphics, king size beds with flitting on high-end, and headboards amenities. The furnishings are practical works of art with swirling plush velvet materials and design details. Named Opulent Swank, Munificent, Splendour and Fire, the five suites offer modern sophistication with a few boasting big balconies and separate sitting rooms.\r\n\r\nThe resort has two notable dining choices with its first being Casa Tartufo: an intimate, family-run Italian restaurant focusing on truffle dishes. It isn't an excessively challenging site but instead an honest and bona fide eatery offering food that is truly excellent. There's a chef's kitchen as good for little soirées or cooking exhibitions. Together with his wife, the eatery’s chef also manage Aria upstairs, an al fresco space -style Italian varieties.\r\n\r\nThe Scarlet is a real boutique property drenched in tradition and history. It is expensive, using a design theory that is powerful, and is ideal for all those looking to escape the foreseeable cookie-cutter hotel experience. Although It’s not for all, that's precisely what causes it to be so intriguing.",

With the world’s greatest tennis court located 1,000 feet above ground on the Burj Al Arab Hotel’s roof, the Persian Gulf may shortly have the first submerged court.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year, Poland-based 8 + 8 Concept Studio released their theory plans for an underwater tennis facility that they’re expecting will hold seven courts. Essentially an inverse aquarium, where we’re the pictures reveal enormous curved glass ceilings giving viewers the whole ocean to gaze up at. Based on Arabian Business, 8 + 8 creator Krzysztof Koala sees the $1.7-$2.5 billion job as combining the finest of “technology, ecology and sport.”\r\n\r\nYou can find apparently lots of technical problems which could hinder the performance, like playability and security, but Kotala continues to be planning on moving forward with the concept. Though there has not been any actual news, the architect, and prospective US investors are seemingly now discussing.\r\n\r\nThere better be a fast escape route should they expect us to remain down there, although we adore the thought of seeing a tennis match from beneath the ocean.",

A D Lab architecture company used nature and designed the house in a very treehouse-like manner. Its highlight is its utilization of grass, which are available on each floor as well as extends into some living spaces.\r\n\r\nIn line with the firm, they needed to amplify the site’s attractiveness and satisfy the requirements of the owners at once.

          "Check out what the most skillful luxury SUV, the 2016 range rover HSE Td6 can do",
        body: "The initial strategy was to take a quick jaunt up the coast to the enchanting town of Providence, Rhode Island together with the wife and pup in tow for 36 hours of relaxation. Getting the new 2016 Range Rover HSE Td6 at our disposal looked like an ideal getaway vehicle: luxurious, cozy, quiet and sturdy enough to handle any potholes on the highway. A spell of wet weather might have derailed our strategies of relaxation, but it brought a new off-road rendezvous where we could test the latest Variety out and find out what its motor could manage.\r\n\r\nAmong the key parameters for our evaluation of the newest Rover was to check out the range of its Td6 diesel motor—which supplies unprecedented fuel economy to get a 5,485-pound high-end beast. With up to 25 mpg put together and up to 658 miles of accessible mileage per tank of fuel, the turbocharged Td6 shows this Range Rover to function as the most opportunistic of the whole lineup.\r\n\r\nA 3.0-liter V6 engine is the keystone of the Td6. Though it provides a small 254 horsepower, besides, it boasts 440 lb.-ft. of torque at a lowly 1,750 rpm. It’s this kind of torque—with their infamous four-wheel drive—that propelled us through the stone-laden woods of Northern New Jersey. Using a more modern take on the original iron engine block, the Compacted Graphite Iron (CGI) is smaller and lighter than its counterpart, which makes it compact in nature.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the recent launch of the Td6 motor, customer adoption surpassed, or has equaled Land Rover’s expectancies. Jaguar Land Rover North America Product Communications Manager, Nathan Hoyt says, “[Land Rover] was projecting a take speed of around 15-20 percent, but we’ve gone ahead of that with about 25 percentages of the full-size Range Rover sales which is the Td6 diesel.”\r\nUnlike most big trucks with diesel motors, the automobile is subliminally silent thanks to completely sealed doors, windows with acoustic laminate and double-isolation engine mounts. A sizable majority of owners won’t ever come to see the seclusion of among the world’s finest cocoons deep but there’s little worry of the encompassing woodlands and also the challenges presented when they do.\r\n\r\nWith all that torque accessible, an eight-speed transmission with a lot of low gearing and 4WD comes the capacity actually to crawl over any obstructions in your way. Adaptive Dynamic suspension lifts to a height of 11.6 inches above the earth, which is great deal for most fallen trees and mud bogs.\r\n\r\nUndulations, vertical rise, three-wheeled driving and balancing through big swaths of terrain demand a system improved enough to ensure it is possible to move out of any scenario. Fortunately, all Range Rovers are designed with all the Terrain Reply 2 system. The system comprises of air suspension, with numerous detectors figuring out you’re pushing the envelope. It is very sophisticated that there’s no need ever manually to input an absolute mode.\r\n\r\nWe are going to say; nevertheless, the Td6 isn't too sensitive at low RPMs. There’s turbo lag that does not look refined enough for a version of this quality. It’s a minimal fault—one that you might not see—but for snobs of finesse and combustion, it’s there in plain sight.\r\n\r\nThe Eyesight Support Package (a $2,110 choice) adds added cameras to help when browsing obstructions, but it stills doesn't feel reactive or varied enough to replace spotters and photographic memory. Range Rover can (and should) update the device into a higher quality. We recommend the High Specification Edition (HSE) alternative as a $7,000 alternative bundle. Contained is a superbly-broad panoramic roof, posh self-closing doors and customizable 14-way leather seats that are perforated.\r\n\r\nThe Range Rover Td6 and a fresh motor to surpass it meet what's needed of the best group of upscale SUVs. This new powertrain gets to the heart of what Range Rover and Land Rover stand for: the possible skill to navigate everywhere without worrying about running out of fuel.\r\n\r\nThe weather discourages our strategies to unwind rather offered the possibility to examine this earthbound legend in where it’s practically house. Opportunities are most motorists could not step foot off the trodden trail, but the truth is the abilities are there. We believe you’ll be hard pressed to locate a car apart from the 2016 Range Rover Td6 HSE that can allow you handle any expected challenges to drive nearly 700 miles and paddle in up to three feet of water, all surrounded by relaxation.",

        title: "How to cope up with nightmares",
        body: "For many people, nightmares are a major barrier to a good night’s sleep. Getting enough sleep is necessary for your body to operate as it should. While the amount of sleep you need differs from person to person, it’s generally recommended that adults get between 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night. In today’s fast-paced world, it’s common to “get by” on a lot less. Many people are so sleep-deprived, they don’t even notice the effects on their bodies! Some people even brag about how little they sleep, or how they “run on coffee”.\r\n\r\nSleep is so essential, that not getting enough sleep is correlated to everything from weight gain, to heart disease, weakening of the immune system, distractibility that can lead to increased risk of accidents, and much more.\r\n\r\nNightmares in adults can be caused by certain types of medication; PTSD, depression, anxiety or sleep disorders; stress and more.\r\n\r\nWhat can you do when you’re struggling with sleep deprivation due to recurring nightmares?\r\n\r\n●Get out of bed. Don’t torture yourself by lying in bed for hours after waking up from a nightmare. If you can’t fall back asleep, get out of bed. Make yourself some chamomile tea, go for a five-minute walk or take a shower. Doing this can give your body and mind a kind of “reset” that will help you fall back asleep quickly.\r\n●Keep a dream journal. When you wake up from a dream, write down everything you can remember about it. You’ll probably find out common themes that keep showing up in the nightmares. When you identify these themes, you can look closely at your life and deal with the issues.\r\n●Talk it out. Bottling things up makes them have a stronger hold on you. In addition to the relief you’ll feel from letting things out, talking to someone else about your nightmares can offer you a different perspective, and perhaps some solution. Maybe you see no connection between your dreams and what’s going on in your life. A friend or therapist can offer some ideas.\r\n●Practice good sleep hygiene. Some people report having nightmares after eating too close to bedtime. Making sure you have a regular sleeping schedule and practice sleep hygiene can improve your overall quality of sleep. Make sure you only use your bed for sleeping and having sex. Eat your last meal several hours before going to bed, and avoid screens (TV, computers, and smartphones) for at least an hour before going to sleep. Keep your room well ventilated and make sure it is not too hot or cold.\r\n●Take active steps to reduce stress in your life. Whether that’s making sure you don’t bite off more than you can chew (you really don’t have to accept every invitation) or adopting new stress-busting habits, this is an important step. Stress is one of the main causes of nightmares in adults. Yoga isn’t the only thing you can do. Try different forms of exercise, breathing techniques, and meditation.\r\n●See a specialist. If your nightmares are recurring and are seriously getting in the way of your everyday life, it’s time to see a specialist. First, you can discuss with your doctor if any medication you take might be the cause of your nightmares and find another course of action. If you’re not on any medication or are unable to change the medication you take, your doctor might refer you to a sleep specialist.\r\n\r\nDealing with recurring nightmares is a horrible experience. The stress from experiencing nightmares can unfortunately make nightmares even more likely to occur. We hope that these tips can help you break out of this negative pattern.",

Not getting enough sleep can be risky.\r\n\r\nBecause nightmares often lead to sleep deprivation, it increases the stress in our daily life. Of course, more stress in life increases the risk of having more nightmares. To the nightmare suffer, it seems to be an endless loop with no end in sight.\r\n\r\nTo stop having nightmares, it is important to understand why we have them in the first place.
